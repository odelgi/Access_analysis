## A livelihood-specific access index for the analysis of the social impacts of commodity frontier expansion in the Argentine Gran Chaco
We developed a novel measure of access to rural livelihood opportunities to analyze 
the social impacts of commodity frontier expansion. This approach is demonstrated here
in Python and implemented for the Department of Pellegrini in the Argentine Gran Chaco.

This repository accompanies the following peer-reviewed publication 
[del Giorgio O., Messager M. L., le Polain de Waroux Y (year) title. _journal_](link) and
the accompanying [data repository](url).

## Project description
[Short abstract-like paragraph]    
[Method diagram]

## Getting Started
#### Software prerequisites (what we ran this on)
* 64-bit Windows 10 
* Python 2.7 as part of ESRI ArcGIS for Desktop 10.8 
[Background Geoprocessing (64 Bit)](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/executing-tools/64bit-background.htm)
* Python IDE (e.g. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/promo/?gclid=CjwKCAjwmf_4BRABEiwAGhDfSaGbHthcudKiCTLaWZWj7-MdcAC_4mIWlJ8vWtQTbBAFptMMC_8hvBoC6v4QAvD_BwE))

#### Hardware recommendation
* This analysis was run at 30 m resolution for the Department of Pellegrini, which spans 7,330 km<sup>2</sup>.
* All of the analysis was run on a workstation with the following specs:
    * Intel® Core™ i9-9940X X-series Processor (14 physical cores, 19.25M Cache, up to 4.50 GHz)
    * 64 GB RAM
    * Samsung SSD 970 ECO Plus 500GB
* We estimate that, without significant issues, the analysis would take between 45 and 60 days to run 24/7 on all 14 cores.

#### Input data
To obtain all input data and products, download the accompanying [data repository](url).

#### Project structure
The scripts contained in this Github repository will only function if contextualized within a specific directory
structure, provided in the data repository. The data repository already includes the scripts required to run the 
analysis as they existed at the time of the publication of the accompanying peer-reviewed article.

If there have been updates to the source code since publication; these will be detailed in this README. 
In this case, download this repository into the /src folder within the data repository.
